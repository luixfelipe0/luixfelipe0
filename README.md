# Hey, I'm Luiz Felipe 👋

I'm a final-year Software Analysis and Development student and a Java enthusiast. My focus is on building practical solutions, from my experience as an intern to the personal projects I'm developing right now.

I’m currently diving deep into the **Java ecosystem (Spring Boot, MongoDB, Postgres)** and Android development.

### What I’m building:
* **EldenBuilds:** An Android app I’m developing to help the Elden Ring community manage and calculate their character builds.
* **Spring Product Management:** A backend project focused on product administration, where I implemented features like Stripe webhooks for payments and SendGrid for email notifications.

I'm constantly working to improve my knowledge of **Spring Security, Room, and LiveData** to build more secure and efficient applications.
